# FLITChart Task

This repository contains the interview task for FLIT. 

# Dependencies
- There was no external dependency used, a custom simple chart was implemented for the task (which is not fully finished, but it works)

# Design decisions
- The architecture of the screen is using a simple MVVM architecture due the simplicity of the screen.
- The task was implemented using TDD methodology which resulted in a 83% test coverage
- The screen supports dark mode and landscape orientation 

# Recommendations to improve the screen usability
- Explain to the user what the different lines mean and why there are 4
- Add a slider to easily increase / decrease the values of the textfields
- Add nice animations to the chart when the screen presented and the values have changed
